# CS-210-Programs_NW

This project is an application to help compute monthly compound interest with and without additional monthly contributions. This project asks the user to input their initial investment amount, monthly contribution, interest rate, and number of years. After getting input parameters the program will output a report for Compound interest without monthly contributions and compound interest with monthly contributions. I think that the code overall is well written and clearly readable. I think that separating my code into different files would help clean up my code a lot and make it even more readable and understandable than it is currently. I also think I should have added another function to format each chart that is produced instead of putting the formatting for the charts inside of the calculation function. This project helped me get more comfortable with coding in C++ in general, but it helped me the most to learn ways of converting data types and how to manipulate them.
